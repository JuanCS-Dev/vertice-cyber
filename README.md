## 🌌 Overview
**Vértice Cyber** is a next-generation security infrastructure built on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It orchestrates 8 specialized Meta-Agents working in harmony to perform tasks ranging from ethical audits to real-time wargame simulations, all governed by the **MAXIMUS 2.0** code constitution.

---

## 🖥️ Command Center Dashboard
Futuristic interface built with **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Glassmorphism 2.0**, offering real-time telemetry and full control over the agent fleet.

## 🤖 The Meta-Agent Fleet

| Agent | Specialty | Core Capability |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **⚖️ Ethical Magistrate** | Governance | 7-phase validation against ethical frameworks. |
| **🔍 OSINT Hunter** | Intelligence | Deep target investigation with Smart Cache and AI. |
| **🔮 Threat Prophet** | Prediction | MITRE ATT&CK mapping and vector prediction. |
| **🛡️ Compliance Guardian** | Audit | Automated framework assessment (GDPR, HIPAA, etc). |
| **🛠️ CyberSec Investigator** | Reconnaissance | Advanced port scanning and web header analysis. |
| **🧬 Patch Validator ML** | Defense | ML-based security analysis of code patches. |
| **👁️ Visionary Sentinel** | Multimodal | Forensic analysis of images and documents via Computer Vision. |
| **⚔️ Wargame Executor** | Offensive | Attack scenario simulation in isolated Docker Sandbox. |

---

## 🧠 Inference Engine: Gemini 3 Series
The system utilizes a **Dual-Brain** architecture via Vertex AI, enabling real-time model switching to optimize latency and depth:

- **Gemini 3 Pro**: For complex analysis, code audits, and critical ethical decisions.
- **Gemini 3 Flash**: For rapid triage, initial recon, and low-latency responses.

---

## 🔬 Scientific Validation (PTC-02)
All components undergo rigorous latency and accuracy testing.
- **Agent Success Rate**: 100%
- **Heuristic Latency**: < 10ms
- **Automatic Fallback**: Active for 100% of external providers.
