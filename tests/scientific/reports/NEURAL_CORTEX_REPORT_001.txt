Scientific Test Report - Vertice Cyber v3.0
===========================================
Date: 2026-01-21
Protocol: NEURAL-CORTEX-01
Status: PASSED

TEST CASES:
-----------

[PASS] LIF-01: Agent Lifecycle (Atomic Transitions)
- Spawned: wargame_executor
- Paused: SUCCESS
- Terminated: SUCCESS
- Latency: <15ms per transition

[PASS] NEU-01: Neural Link (Event Propagation)
- Trigger: /api/v1/agents/spawn (POST)
- Event: agent.lifecycle.spawned
- Source: orchestrator
- Latency: ~10ms (Local Loopback)
- Integrity: Payload verified

OBSERVATIONS:
-------------
The Neural Mesh is functionally intact. WebSocket events are propagating concurrently with API state changes. 
The system adheres to the "Obrigação da Verdade" (Events reflect Reality).
